# Web-Dev-Projects

A compilation of projects following WashU's CSE330 'Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming' class.

Recommended by many of my peers at WashU, I decided to follow the course material and complete every project covered in the class.
Started in February 2018, this repository is used as the version control as well as recordings of my growth as a web developer.

List of topics involved:

Module 1

skipped. HTML and CSS stuff

---

**Module 2 (FileSharing)**

Linux, AWS(EC2), SSH, Apache, PHP

In this project, Linux 'chown' and 'chmod' commands gave me a lot of trouble.
Naturally, just like any other rookie dev, I locked myself out of the server at one point.

---

**Module 3 (RUIddit)**

PHP, MySQL, Web App Security (SQL Injection)

My first full stack web app.
It was significantly harder than I imagined.
It was the first milestone in my web dev learning journey.
(The CSS is hideous and I want to keep it that way)

---

**Module 4 (Regex)**

Python, Regular Expressions

Ongoing but probably won't get to it.
I learned Python and regex through other projects.

---

**Module 5 (Calendar)**

CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Javascript, Ajax, Vue.js, Laravel

Took a break during this project to focus on my job.
I shifted my focus on learning better front-end practices and technologies.
For the calculator portion, I threw in a calculator built with Vue.js.
For Calendar, I want to complete the assignment using Laravel as the backend and Vue as the front.
