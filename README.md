# Web-Dev-Projects

A compilation of projects following WashU's CSE330 'Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming' class.

Recommended by many of my peers at WashU, I decided to follow the course material and complete every project covered in the class.
Started in February 2018, this repository is used as the version control as well as recordings of my growth as a web developer.

List of topics involved:

## Module 1

skipped. HTML and CSS stuff

---

## Module 2 (FileSharing)

- Linux
- AWS(EC2)
- SSH
- Apache
- PHP

In this project, Linux 'chown' and 'chmod' commands gave me a lot of trouble.
Naturally, just like any other rookie dev, I locked myself out of the server at one point.

## Module 3 (RUIddit)

- PHP
- MySQL
- Web App Security (SQL Injection)

My first full stack web app.
It was significantly harder than I imagined.
It was the first milestone in my web dev learning journey.
(CSS left a lot to desire but I want to keep it as is to see where I came from)

## Module 4 (Regex)

- Python
- Regular Expressions

Ongoing but probably won't get to it.
I learned Python and regex through other projects.

---

## Module 5 (Calendar)

- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript 
- Ajax
- Vue.js

Took a break during this project to focus on my job.
I shifted my focus on learning better front-end practices and technologies.
For the calculator portion, I also threw in a calculator built with Vue.

For the main project, original plan is to build it using Laravel and Vue.
Realizing the time it will take me to learn the proper development of a SPA using Laravel and Vue, I decided against it and plan to do this framework-less.

## Module 6 

Coming soon!
