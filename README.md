#Web-Dev-Projects
A compilation of projects following WashU's CSE330 'Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming' class. 

Recommended by many of my peers at WashU, I decided to follow the course material and complete every project covered in the class. Started in February 2018, I'm using this repository both as the version controller as well as keeping track of my growth as a web developer. 

List of topics involved:

FileSharing: Linux, Bash, AWS, SSH, Apache, PHP

RUIddit: PHP, MySQL

Regex: Python, Regular Expressions (ongoing but probably won't get to it)

Calculator: CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Javascript, Vue.js
