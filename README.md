# Web-Dev-Projects

A compilation of projects following WashU's CSE330 'Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming' class. 

Recommended by many of my peers at WashU, I decided to follow the course material and complete every project covered in the class. Started in February 2018, I'm using this repository both as the version controller as well as keeping track of my growth as a web developer. 

List of topics involved:

**FileSharing**: Linux, Bash, AWS, SSH, Apache, PHP

In this project, Linux user and permissions gave me a lot of trouble

---

**RUIddit**: PHP, MySQL 

My first full stack web app. Took me a week to get things right.

---

**Regex**: Python, Regular Expressions 

Ongoing but probably won't get to it. Learned regex through other projects.

---

**Calendar**: CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Javascript, Vue.js

Took a break during this project to focus on my job. When I come back to this, I shifted my focus on learning better front-end practices and technologies. Decided to incorporate Vue into this project.
